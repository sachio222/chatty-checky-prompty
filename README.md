# Chatty, Checky, Prompty Algorithm

The Chatty, Checky, Prompty Algorithm works with three LLM models to generate, validate, and improve prompts in a collaborative manner. The algorithm establishes an interactive loop between the three models, with Chatty generating prompts, Checky validating them, and Prompty suggesting improvements.

## Dependencies

- `langchain/chat_models`
- `langchain/schema`

## Usage

1. Import the handler function from the `chatGan.js` file.
2. Call the handler function with the desired output as an input parameter.
3. The function returns a promise, which resolves to the correct prompt generated by the algorithm.

### Example

```javascript
import { handler } from './chatGan.js';

(async () => {
  const desiredOutput = 'some desired output';
  const correctPrompt = await handler({ query: { desiredOutput } });

  console.log('Correct Prompt:', correctPrompt);
})();
